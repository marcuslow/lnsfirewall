# pfSense Firewall Management System - Resume Notes

## Current Status
- **System**: pfSense client "opus-1" connected to HQ server via WebSocket
- **AI Console**: Working with Rules Query Engine (RQE) and new Logs Query Engine (LQE)
- **Last Commit**: 65fe55c - "LQE: fix field mapping for pfBlockerNG logs"

## What We Found

### 1. Log Collection Issue
- **Problem**: AI console showed "0 entries" when querying logs
- **Root Cause**: Field mapping mismatch between client and LQE
  - Client sends: `source_ip`, `dest_ip`, `protocol`, `source_port`, `dest_port`
  - LQE expected: `src`, `dst`, `proto`, `src_port`, `dst_port`

### 2. pfSense Logging Status
- **Filter logs**: MISSING - `/var/log/filter.log` doesn't exist (firewall logging disabled)
- **pfBlockerNG logs**: PRESENT - `/var/log/pfblockerng/ip_block.log` has blocked connections
- **Sample data**: Shows blocked attempts on ports 17001, 2375, 12319, 3389, 9213

### 3. AI Behavior Issues
- AI was defaulting to 7 days instead of remembering requested window (3 days)
- AI was calling wrong tools ("request_client_logs" instead of "get_stored_logs")

## What Was Fixed

### 1. LQE Field Mapping (hq/lqe.py)
- Added `LogEntry.from_dict()` method to handle multiple field naming conventions
- Maps both pfBlockerNG format and future filter log format
- Removed duplicate `_normalize()` method

### 2. AI Memory Enhancement (hq/ai_command_center.py)
- Added `last_logs_request_days` dictionary to remember requested windows per client
- Modified `query_logs()` to use remembered window instead of defaulting to 7 days
- Fixed tool parameter passing to respect user-specified timeframes

### 3. Syntax and Testing
- All modules compile successfully
- LQE smoke test passes (2 blocked, 2 allowed from sample data)
- Ready for real data testing

## What Needs Testing

### 1. Immediate Test (pfBlockerNG logs only)
1. **Restart AI console** to pick up changes
2. **Request logs**: "Get me 3 days log opus-1"
3. **Wait 30-60 seconds** for collection
4. **Query blocked**: "How many blocked connections on opus-1?"
5. **Expected**: Should show actual blocked counts from pfBlockerNG (not 0)

### 2. Enable pfSense Filter Logging
1. **Web GUI**: https://103.26.150.122
2. **Navigate**: Status → System Logs → Settings
3. **Enable**: 
   - ✅ "Log firewall default blocks"
   - ✅ "Log packets matched by firewall rules"
4. **Save** and generate test traffic
5. **Verify**: `ls -la /var/log/filter.log*` should show files
6. **Test**: Request logs again, should see both pfBlockerNG and filter entries

### 3. Comprehensive Testing
- Test various queries: "ssh logs", "port 80", "IP 192.168.x.x"
- Verify window memory: request 3 days, then query without specifying days
- Test with mixed log sources (pfBlockerNG + filter logs)

## SSH Access
- **File**: `ssh_pfsense.bat` (created for easy access)
- **IP**: 103.26.150.122
- **User**: admin
- **Password**: Lns12345678()

## Key Files Modified
- `hq/lqe.py` - Log Query Engine with field mapping fix
- `hq/ai_command_center.py` - Enhanced memory and tool behavior
- `tests/lqe_smoke.py` - Offline testing script

## Expected Outcome
After testing, the AI should correctly:
1. Remember requested log windows (3 days vs 7 days)
2. Find and analyze pfBlockerNG blocked connections
3. Handle both pfBlockerNG and filter log formats seamlessly
4. Provide accurate counts and summaries without sending raw logs to AI models

## Next Session Commands
1. Read this file: "Get context from resume.txt"
2. Test immediately: "Get me 3 days log opus-1" then "How many blocked connections?"
3. If working, enable filter logging and retest
